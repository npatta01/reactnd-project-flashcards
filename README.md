## How to Load the App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and uses the Yarn package manager.

You can find directions for installing Yarn here: [Yarn Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Once Yarn is installed, open up your command shell and navigate to the directory where you want to store the app and run
```
git clone git@github.com:npatta01/reactnd-project-flashcards.git
yarn 
```

You can view the project through an emulator like [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) or directly through your android or iPhone by connecting the mobile phone to using the Expo app.

When the app has loaded a QRcode will appear in the shell window.  Press `a` to open the app with the emulator or connected device -- or -- scan the QR code in the Expo app.

If you have difficulty connecting to the app you can use the [Expo XDE](https://expo.io/tools) to connect your device.  

## Platform
